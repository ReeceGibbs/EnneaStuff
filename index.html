          <h3>The Basic Personality Type</h3>
          <!-- using a blockquote here because it looks nice and the information is paraphrased from another author -->
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            The Enneagram is a set of nine different personality types. Each one of us falls into the category of
            <i>one</i> of the nine types. Although it is common to
            see aspects of your personality in each and every one of them, the description of only <i>one</i> of the
            types
            will align itself most closely
            with your personality. Most major Enneagram authors agree that we are born with an overriding personality
            type. This subsequently determines, in large part, how
            we interact with our early childhood environment. Because of this, by the time we are about five years of
            age,
            we will have developed our seperate sense of self
            and we will approach all aspects of life in a way that can be understood by studying our Enneagram type.

            <!-- important list of points to consider -->
            <h6>The following points need to be made about the basic personality type:</h6>
            <ol>
              <li>People do not change from one basic personality type to another.</li>
              <li>The descriptions of the personality types are universal and apply equally
                to males and females, since no type is inherently masculine or feminine.</li>
              <li>Not everything in the description of your basic type will apply to you
                all the time because you fluctuate constantly among the healthy, average,
                and unhealthy traits that make up your personality type.</li>
              <li>The Enneagram uses numbers to designate each of the types because numbers
                are value neutral - they imply the whole range of attitudes and behaviors of
                each type without specifying anything either positive or negative. Unlike the
                labels used in psychiatry, numbers provide an unbiased, shorthand way of indicating
                a lot about a person without being pejorative.</li>
              <li>The numerical ranking of the types is not significant. A larger number is
                no better than a smaller number; it is not better to be a Nine than a
                Two because nine is a bigger number.</li>
              <li>No type is inherently better or worse than any other. While all the personality
                types have unique assets and liabilities, some types are often considered to be more
                desirable than others in any given culture or group. Furthermore, for one reason or another,
                you may not be happy being a particular type. You may feel that your type is “handicapped”
                in some way. As you learn more about all the types, you will see that just as each has unique
                capacities, each has different limitations. If some types are more esteemed in Western society
                than others, it is because of the qualities that society rewards, not because of any superior
                value of those types. The ideal is to become your best self, not to imitate the assets of
                another type.</li>
            </ol>

          <h3>Identifying Your Basic Personality Type</h3>

            In order to identify your own basic personality type. It is advised that you take a test that is
