  <h3>What's it all about?</h3>
  <p>
    EnneaStuff is a website designed to familiarise people with the concept of the Enneagram.<br>
    The Enneagram is a system used to 'type' people based on their personality traits and the way in which they interact with their environment.
    Being able to type yourself and others can be a valuable skill and can greatly improve not only the degree to which you understand yourself,
    but your engagement with all those you come into contact with.
